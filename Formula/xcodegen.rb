    # so homebrew patched environment variable to get it work.
    # But since Xcode 9.3 includes it already, the build will fail
    # because of redefinition of libxml2 module.
    # It's a bug of homebrew but before it's fixed, it's easier
    # to provide in-place workaround for now.
    # Please remove this once homebrew is patched.
